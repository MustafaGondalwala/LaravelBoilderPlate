                                <p>Web development is the entire process of developing a website. It is basically the process of building and maintaining a website.

The main difference between web development and website design is that in web design, the designer comes up with the user interface of the website.

In contrast, the web developer integrates web design into the web development process. The functionality of the website, application, and basically how the website works is done during the website development process.</p>

                                        <p>E-commerce is the buying and selling of goods and services online. E-commerce development is the process of building these websites into online stores ready to handle floods of customers. These firms work to understand each client’s specific business objectives and select the best developers from their companies to meet customer needs. Developers analyze those needs, craft a design plan, establish web hosting, and then launch the online stores. With the online shopping experience expanding onto multiple channels, e-commerce software is necessary to ensure seamless integration. These tools include payment gateways, subscription management, and live chat.</p>
